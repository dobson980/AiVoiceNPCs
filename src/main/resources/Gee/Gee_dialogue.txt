Player: I fancy a bit of a fight, anything dangerous?
Gee: Perhaps you could check it out if you are as brave as you say?
Gee: Well done! However I'm sure if you search around the world you will find more challenging foes to slay.
Gee: Sounds like it could be a quest for you?
Gee: It's funny really, the cook would forget his head if it wasn't screwed on. This time he forgot to get ingredients for the Duke's birthday cake.
Player: He wouldn't let me kill his chickens though.
Gee: You will have to wait until he isn't looking.
Gee: RedBeard Frank in Port Sarim's bar, the Rusty Anchor, might be able to tell you about the rumoured treasure that is buried somewhere in Gielinor.
Gee: Hetty the witch can be found in Rimmington, south of Falador. She's currently working on some new potions. Perhaps you could give her a hand? She might be able to offer help with your magical abilities.
Gee: Did she really?
Player: Yes, I have already solved the rune mysteries.
Gee: Romeo in Varrock needs help with finding his beloved Juliet, you may be able to help him out.
Gee: Unless of course you manage to find Juliet first in which case she has probably lost Romeo.
Gee: Oh good, Thank you ASuperDood!
